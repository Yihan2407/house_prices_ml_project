# House Pricing ML Project
Given 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, I attempt to predict the property's sale price using regression techniques. Examples of explanatory variables include the neighborhood the property resides in, size of the garage, year it was sold, the general shape of the property as well as the above grade living area square feet. I first conducted exploratory data analysis, before proceeding onto data processing & cleaning, imputation of missing values, feature transformation as well as feature engineering to try and maximize the predictive capability of my models. Then, I experimented with several regression models such as Ridge Regression, ElasticNet Regression and Random Forest Regression. Overall, it was a really fun dataset to play around with, and the abundance of predictor variables made for some interesting ways to approach feature transformation and feature engineering.
